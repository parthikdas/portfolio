1. used snap for the scrolling effect
2. used inbuilt tailwind feature for light and dark mode - So we did not use context or anything to check in whole app
    - tailwind config file
    - globals.css
    - use them in page.js
3. used mutation observer to track the change in theme

Todo : 
add rest with some other effect or letssee
use reactbits for other section
